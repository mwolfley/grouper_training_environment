Conventions
===========

In the documentation, many references will be made to Grouper groups and
folders. These references will sometimes take the form of a complete path to
the referenced object, such as `:app:vpn:service:ref:ad_hoc`. Other times, the
references will be relative to the current context under discussion. For
example, when referring to the same application-specific reference group for
the VPN service, the notation `...:ref:ad_hoc` may be used to indicate that a
portion of the full path has been omitted.
