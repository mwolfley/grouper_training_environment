Access Goverance Practicum (401)
================================

The practicum consists of four labs where students can apply the knowledge they
have learned from previous Grouper courses. Students can demostrate how to
implement access goverance using Grouper and associated `InCommon Trusted
Access Platform`_ components by translating natural language policy into the
appropriate digital policy. The access governance practicum incorporates much
of the InCommon Trusted Access Platform and provides a “full IAM stack”
experience.
